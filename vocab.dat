 Demons
 Den er meget framentarisk, viser scener på en måde som nok hænger sammen i en historie, men alligevel er meget singulære. det minder mig lidt om godard
 Den fungerer lidt som en kolage som deles ind a tekststykker mellem scenerne - selvom der er et samlende narrativ gennem alle scenerne. den har virkelig mange fine passager. den var tangerende firre en halve på visse tidspunkter
 Den har et lidt sjovt sammenfald mellem på en måde at være den store fortælling om kærligheden og på en anden måde at være tilfærdigt, tumlende hen ad vejen-historie, hvor de ikke engang ender op sammen i slutnignen
 Den startede virkelig godt. han er genial med hans magtundergravende tørre humor. men da historien begyndte at fylde for meget i anden halvdel af filmen gik det sjove desværre ud af filmen
 Den stiller spørgsmålet hvorvidt der er noget dybere spirituelt gemt i øjnene end den blotte materie og 'data', men den tør ikke helt svare på spørgsmålet, hvorfor den ender på en meget åben og uopklaret måde.
 Den var sgu ret fin. den er sÃ¥dan lidt fragmentarisk i det. en masse scener.
 Den var virkelig solid. den havde en eller anden fin rytme ved sig, en ro, som bare kørte derudaf i fantastisk balance. Karaktererne og miljøet var fantastisk

 I Don't Get It
 I Don't Think Arms Dealers Look Anything Like Nick Cage
 I Guess Nude Terminators Can't Kill A Really Bad Film
 I Just Kept Hearing Massive Attack After The Car Accident
 I Love Movies Top Pick
 I See you
 I am Legend
 I am a big Adrien Brody fan and he did not dissappoint me here
 I am your father
 I came out loving it
 I can do without.
 I can watch it again
 I can't turn away
 I despise documentaries like this.
 I didn't find it confusing
 I didn't get it.
 I didn't return for the sequel
 I don't get it: what's there to get? tell me...
 I don't have to explain my art to you Warren
 I don't know
 I don't think I got it; willing to try again
 I expected More
 I fell on sleep...
 I felt sweded
 I had my doubts with that anti-Republican talk - but I was just moody
 I hate Eminem-- but this movie is good
 I hate Summer
 I hate this movie. Great casting
 I have difficulty cheering for a hooker
 I heel toe on Uday's house
 I just lost the game
 I know it by heart
 I laughed at its satire
 I laughed continuosly throughout this film
 I laughed.
 I like it when 94 minutes seem long
 I love the depth of love achieved without any physicality
 I love the man-machine myme of sci-fi
 I love the powerglove
 I love this movie
 I loved it! Seen it five times already!
 I loved it. Well acted
 I need a time machine so I can stop myself from seeing this movie
 I never knew justice could be so funny. Try this one
 I pelicula
 I see dead people
 I think I should watch this again with subtitles...
 I think i'm going to vomit
 I think there was one really good joke or two
 I want I talking lion
 I want number 5.
 I wanted the bad guy to win.  Sean Bean out-Bonds Bond.
 I wanted to hug this movie
 I went to becuase there wasn't anything else
 I wish I could do that
 I would rather suck exhaust than watch this POS again.
 I wouldn't watch more than once - but it made me cry
 I'd of killed those people too if I were her
 I'm Devon Butler!
 I'm embarassed to find this funny
 I'm feeling apologetic for not liking this movie
 I'm not even supposed to be here today
 I'm on a Boat
 I'm sure there must be something clever here...
 I'm too scared to see this

 If you like Kaurismaki movies this movie might also be for you
 If you like the TV show
 If you particularly valued the drama ingredients of this movie I recommend seeing "The Son's Room" (2001)
 If you want a more embellished story of prostitution watch Pretty Woman instead

 It Just Goes To Show Ya Once The Ring Goes On It's Just Leftovers

 It is a nice movie
 It shows exactly how people speak in that part of the country
 It starts
 It was an absolutely lovely
 It was melodramatic and kind of dumb
 It's 1 Part Bad Memories  1 Part Double Cross Add  A Twist Of Slime & Lots Of Good Vibrations!
 It's Biased When Watanabe Uses A 45 And Kills Himself
 It's Not Just A Phase It's Really A Way Of Life
 It's Not Size Of Your Stick But Why You Keep On Swingin' It!
 It's The Journey Not The Destination That We Should Enjoy
 It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
 It's a flavor of todays corruption
 It's a real history
 It's cheeky
 It's not a tumor
 It's really his own damn fault

 The ending/It's really corny!
 The ensemble of previous Anderson movies coming together in a whoole new beautiful world
 The fact that Ellen Page died.
 The fact that Isolde betrayed a man as honourable as Lord Marke. I can't stand people who have affairs.
 The fall of the Berlin wall
 The film about the highschool guy who gets everything his own way
 The first rule of MovieLens is we don't talk about Fight Club

 The greatest Zombie saga continues!!!
 The line
 The most clever dirty movie ever made.
 The most romantic
 The musical aspect
 The never ending weird movie
 The original is soooo much better than the later version. Tells you what it is like to feel good.
 The plot
 The police had awful tactics
 The remake is better
 The rest of the movie
 The second part of the best fucking movies ever!!!!
 The sets
 The setting
 The snake
 The sound design
 The story
 The suspense and round characters and amazing acting and the interesting plot line
 The third part of the best movie ever!!!!
 The thought of an unlimited shopping spree for toys made up for everything else.

 There is nothing good in this film
 There were several remakes

 They Made This Already And It Was Titled: Football Factory It's Way Better Than This Re-Hash

 This Would Have Been Funnier If It Was A Horror Film
 This classic film addresses two current issues PTSD and Mental Health
 This is a bloody movie. Yet I would call it a family movie.
 This is a fun family movie. If you like victorian style British novels
 This is funny
 This is interesting movie with culture and some mental specific colour
 This is my absolute favourite movie ever.
 This is my happy face
 This is the wierdest movie I ever liked
 This movie is one of the best movies of all time.  EVERYONE should watch this movie. It is perfect.
 This movie is perfect
 This movie should have been called "How Cocaine Ruined Disney"
 This movie speaks about the beginning of the AIDS crisis
 This movie will induce vomitting
 This one is real funny. It is also nice. But seems to have a factory finish to it.

 William H. Macy puts forward perhaps his best performance of all time as a miserably unpersuasive Minnesotan car salesman who tries to stage his wife's kidnapping to pay off his debts. Frances McDormand plays the wholesome cop who blends wit

 and I was surprised that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did; I gave it 4.0 stars out of a possible 5.0 stars
 and at times intense family
 and characters
 and is my all time western.
 and sad
 and some good philosphy on life
 and subtely touching film with a bittersweet ending
 and this isn't at all how i pictured most of the characters
 and unwatchable
 and whatever other horribly overrated movies I've grouped this with.
 and why few people seemed concerned

 but amazing swordaction
 but bad

 but his supporting cast was made too quirky in this movie (gun crazy Rosewood really took away from the wit of the movie).
 but in evil liquid metal robot form
 but it's fun.
 but kind of stressful to watch.
 but lighter
 but long
 but mostly for kids

 den bliver lidt fantastisk til sidst, når hun faktisk endelig møder sin long lost love på en bus. men som helhed er filmen lidt for langsommelig og flad i det synes jeg. hovedpersonen brænder igennem og er meget smuk
 den bruger ret mange forskellige filmiske knep løbende, som er ret interessante. så har den også den der superstylistiske ting kørende som på en måde minder lidt om refens film
 den del af filmen hvor han bare går rundt og er fattig og stort set laver ingenting går godt nok utrolig meget i tomgang og bliver meget kedelig. Hvis man skal opleve hans kedsomhed og stilleståenhed så er missionen mere end vellykket
 den er bare opbygget og fortalt virkelig tight og spændende
 den er virkelig smuk
 den er virkelig vildt konstrueret.
 den fungerer meget som en samling af gode scener i sig selv, frem for ét sammensat narrativ
 den har virkelig mange sjove ting kÃ¸rende for sig. vÃ¦sentlig stÃ¦rkere end den fÃ¸rste. synes den lÃ¥ner nogle ting fra moderne sitcom og er i almindelighed meget moderne i sit indhold sÃ¥som netdating. at wifi gÃ¥r i stykker mm
 den havde nogle rigtig flotte skud
 den havde nogle virkelig gode sceancer kÃ¸rende for sig
 den skulle have været mindst 20 min kortere. alle 20 skåret fra fattigdomssekvensen hvor han bare går rundt.
 den spiller ikke efter de faste strukturer hvilket ellers kunne vÃ¦re forventet. den puller heller ikke nogen lame tricks til alt for billige grin. er positivt overrasket over Segels pen
 den starter isÃ¦r godt ud
 den svinger lidt mellem super gode scener og mindre interessante passager, jf. vurdering
 den var meget langsom. men den havde nogle gode momenter og elementer i sig
 den var slet ikke sÃ¥ flot som hans forrige film. dramaet var ikke helt oppe at ringe men jeg mÃ¥ indrÃ¸mme de var lidt fangende
 den vipper ml fille og fille-enhalv. jeg satte den et trin op efter den blev lidt i hovedet

 desvÃ¦rre synes jeg forholdet ml de to er kedsommeligt - det der udgÃ¸r substansen i filmen - fordi de kun taler om logistikken bag deres mÃ¸der og om hvorvidt de kan tillade sig og mÃ¸des osv.
 det bedste ved filmen er ikke de små film han laver, men samspillet mellem ham og von trier. han skal udfordre leth og man ved aldrig helt hvornår irritationen er reel over benspændende. det er et sjovt samspil
 det er en MEGET gavmild 4'er
 det er en lidt atypisk rohmer isÃ¦r den mÃ¥de den starter pÃ¥ i et allerede etableret og ulykkeligt parforhold. forholdene plejer oftere at etablere sig gennem filmen
 det er en sjov detalje at deres lille kriminelle kollektiv er relativ tollerant overfor handsome bobs homoseksualitet. det er hele karakterer selvom mange ting er skarpt optrukne
 det er i øvrigt en sjov detalje, at de ene samleje der er i filmen bliver lavet som sådan en hurtigklippet passage, som fremstiller forløb trivielle og komiske. det er meget sjovt
 det er sgu meget interessant, at det handler om en desperat økonomisk nød i den gamle forstand. han tæller bogstaveligt talt mønterne i sin lomme.
 det er sjovt, jeg sad og ventede på at objektet ville returne the gaze, hvilket skete til sidst da morderen opdager han bliver beskuet.
 det er virkelig en god paris-film ogsÃ¥
 det var sgu en meget fin lille film, et fint lille set up

 er meget splittet om bedømmelsen. i dens gode perioder tænkte jeg 4, måske sågar 4,5. som helhed med fokus på de dårlige sceancer er vi nærmere en 3'er.
 er vild med set-up'et. det minder meget om en teaterscene: helt stiliseret og simpel. det virker næsten bevidst overbelyst.

 i miss jaime kennedy
 i own this
 i starten syntes jeg det stak meget i Ã¸rerne. men det blev til tider ret morsomt. i Ã¸vrigt var det vÃ¦sentligt at der kom noget substantielt narrativ pÃ¥ senere hen hvor starten var en bunke fragmenter
 i thought it would never end
 i wanted to kill myself
 i wanted to stab my self in the face
 i wish i'd never seen it
 i'd like to live in this movie
 i'll never watch this
 i'm as mad as hell and i'm not going to take it any more

 isÃ¦r dens struktur er et fedt projekt: at man hele tiden fÃ¦lger nogle nye som de fÃ¸rste gÃ¥r forbi eller mÃ¸der
 isÃ¦r i starten. den bliver desvÃ¦rre lidt slap i det mod enden hvilket er meget Ã¦rgerligt
 it aint funny
 it could happen
 it couldn't decide what it wanted to be
 it has Eartha Kitt - so that cancels any cheesiness
 it has drama
 it has no saving graces
 it just keeps getting weirder
 it ruined jaime kennedys career
 it should have sucked but didn't
 it sucks
 it thought it was funny but it wasn't
 it was a movie about growing up
 it was creepy
 it was only 1 hr and 28 minutes
 it was only nice
 it was stupid
 it was very Boring and awful
 it wasnt that long
 it's a good movie but the end of 007 is always the same
 it's a mess
 it's all true
 it's alright.
 it's just normal
 it's made of PEOPLE!
 it's over and I'll never see it again
 it's so bad it's actually good
 it's too bad Brendan can't shake the Encino Man syndrome

 kan godt lide det med at den desperate stadig går rundt i jakkesæt. det er på en måde typisk fransk
 kan godt lide ham der spiller hoved rollen. må generelt sige at skuespillet er meget mere nuanceret og fint end jeg huskede hitchcock. breakupet med hans kæreste, den stakkels kvinde, var faktisk ret rørerende
 kan ikke finde den
 kan ikke helt se hvad det gik ud pÃ¥
